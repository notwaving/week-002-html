# Dynamic parts of the user interface

`Number of tasks left` - the number next to this will change according to user input.

Number and name of tasks/categories in the table will change as user adds or deletes them.

## Possible problems

- Can a user add a task without filling in the task and/or category input fields?

- If the user deletes a task by accident they cannot undo this action. Note that the `Delete` button is next to the `Edit` button and could easily be selected in error.

- User cannot reorder tasks

- User cannot display or group tasks by category.

- User has to type category in input field each time. Is there a way for the form to offer autocomplete once a category exists on the table?
